        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Abdul Kamara. I'm 20 years old and was born and raised in London. I've got two brothers and two sisters; all are older than me (pain). Other than sports, I have a huge interest in all things tech and Japanese culture. Previously, I was a data analytics apprentice at GSK. Although it was fun and I learned a lot, I was akways more interest in building pipelines/products rather than analysing data to aid decsion making. I hope to join the next cohort of FutureProof to do just that, whilst having fun too!</p>
